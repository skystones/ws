The simulator will draw from the reduced deck size, shuffle the waiting room back when the deck empties, and automatically apply the one-damage refresh penalty whenever that shuffle happens mid-sequence. This makes it easy to study lines that intentionally compress the deck and to see how refresh timing impacts the damage curve.\n"
