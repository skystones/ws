    "Use `DeckConfig`'s `waiting_room_cards` and `waiting_room_climax_cards` to model game states where cards have already been routed to the waiting room before you start a damage sequence. The simulator will draw from the reduced deck size, shuffle the waiting room back when the deck empties, and automatically apply the one-damage refresh penalty whenever that shuffle happens mid-sequence. This makes it easy to study lines that intentionally compress the deck and to see how refresh timing impacts the damage curve.\n"
